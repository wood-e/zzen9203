This is the secret confession of Richard Buckland
to be revealed by anonymous email if I should
mysteriously vanish.  I have left the last few hex
digits of the SHA256 hash of this message with my
trusted solicitor, Dennis Denuto, which will verify
that this is indeed my intended and unaltered
confession written by me Richard Buckland.

Dennis has not seen this confession he has only seen
the last few digits of the hash.  I have also sent copies
of the last few digits to my bank manager and to my priest
Father Brown.

On the 10th of February I saw Mark Zukerberg near my 
house pretending to want to come and watch Empire Strikes
Back, the greatest Star Wars movie of all time.

He tried to break into my house, but he didn't need to 
break in because he already had my fingerprints, actually
I think Zukerberg is a clone of all humans, wait, is he
really a robot?

I'm not sure what I should be doing but I believe you've
just fallen for a birthday attack.
